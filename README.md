# Objective

This project explores how park score correlates with device screen time for the top 100 most populous US cities. Accessibility to physical activity through parks, as measured by park score, would hopefully provide a reliable measure for user physical activity, measured by screen time for specific app categories.

# Instructions

Run "CS_210_Final_Project.ipynb". The data are all stored in this repo, so there is no need to download anything else.

If you are generating new synthetic data rather than using "screentime.csv" stored in this repo, please observe the instructions in the notebook regarding which code blocks to uncomment / comment out.

# Original dataset

The 2024 ParkScore Index dataset was sourced from here: https://www.tpl.org/parkscore/rankings
